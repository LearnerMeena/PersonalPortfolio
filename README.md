# Project: Personal Web Portfolio

This project is about creating your personal web portfolio which would include contents about your academic information as well as project experiences. Further this can also be used in applying for internship, freelancing etc.
* It should contain a page which talks about you, a contact page where people can contact you, your testimonials, and details of skills you acquired during this course and projects you made during the course. Please include your social media accounts links on your portfolio site as well.
* The website needs to look clean and visually appealing. Make sure you follow best practices of the web design. So, your portfolio needs to represent you in a good way. 
* A simple home page could look like this. But you may apply your creativity to design your own.

## Your Task
Design an attractive website with consistent theme across the entire website. Design a simple interface for your personal portfolio.For a responsive website carefully work for flexible layouts, images and videos, and typography.Your dynamic website must contain the following elements in minimum
* Navigation Bar
* Home Page/Landing Page with Navigation links
* Text without spelling and grammar errors
* Must include at least 8 web pages with related contents (like Projects, Contacts, Documents, etc.)
* Site must function & load without lag in all major browsers (etc.)

 
## Starter Code
There are (mostly) empty files Home.html, About.html, ContactUs.html, Project.html, template.html style.css, and script.js and main.py wired together for you to begin your project. You can add other necessary files and images. All images that are visible on the site must be saved in the images folder and linked from there in your files carefully.
### Step1: Collection of necessary contents.
You can use relevant images, textual information, videos, or audio files. 
### Step2: Installing Flask 
In this step, you’ll create your Python environment and install Flask using the pip package installer.
### Step3: Creating a base application 
Now once the environment is set-up, you will make the web application using a python file.
A sample python file that will handle HTTP requests is provided. 

### Step 4: Create HTML, CSS, and Virtual Environment
Web applications mainly use HTML to display information, so you’ll now work on incorporating HTML files in your app, which can be displayed on the web browser
The files may be structured like - Flask/Templates/<HTML files>
You may create a new HTML file as home.html.
Further add more pages inside the templates folder, as per the web portfolio you plan to design.
To connect all pages you may have a navigation pane on your home page.
Create a CSS folder to store your stylesheets, JavaScript, images, and other necessary files. 
### Step 5: Moving forward with Flask and virtual environment
Use virtualenv to create an isolated environment for your Python project and activate virtual environment.



**Hints**

* Showcase your best testimonials on the homepage. Most developers prefer to use sliders for this, but you can also use rows. 
* Remember to always keep the main.py outside of your templates folder
* The Flask Framework looks for HTML files in a folder called templates. You need to create a templates folder and put all your HTML files in there.
* In the same way as we created a folder called templates to store all our HTML templates, we need a folder called static to keep css, javascript files & images.

## Bonus Task
Features you may add to your Personal Portfolio website
* More High-Quality Images – Your best image from a project should represent it in your portfolio, but you should also add more high-quality images to its individual page.
